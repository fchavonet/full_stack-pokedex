# Pok√©dex

## Description

This project is a responsive Pok√©dex web application built using React. It serves as a training exercise to strengthen my understanding of React and API integration. The app is in French and uses two public APIs: [Tyradex](https://tyradex.vercel.app/) for Pok√©mon data in French and [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for high-resolution images.

I built everything from scratch without using pre-made components, to better practice and improve my React skills.

Features include:

- Region selection to load Pok√©mon by generation.
- Pok√©mon listing per selected region.
- Clickable Pok√©mon to view detailed information.
- Search functionality for quick lookup.

## Objectives

- Gain practical experience with React and component architecture.
- Work with asynchronous JavaScript: fetch(), async/await.
- Manage French-language API data (Tyradex) alongside image retrieval (PokeAPI).
- Build a responsive, user-friendly interface with reusable components.
- Encourage clean, maintainable code practices and state handling.

- Refactor and clean the codebase for improved readability and maintainability.
- Add a dark/light mode toggle for better accessibility.
- Improve error handling with clear, user-friendly messages in case of network issues.

## Thanks

- Many thanks to the developers of [Tyradex](https://tyradex.vercel.app/) and [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for making Pok√©mon data freely accessible in multiple formats.
